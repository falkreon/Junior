Working with Abstract Syntax Trees!


This library will offer:

* Primitives for representing program structure, commands, and calls
* Metaprogramming facilities to transform an AST before it's evaluated
* JVM evaluation framework
* live-console tools
* Assembler to x86-64 elf binary


But, this is a free-time thing so progress may be slow.
