Working with Abstract Syntax Trees!


This library will offer:

* Primitives for representing program structure, commands, and calls
* Metaprogramming facilities to transform an AST before it's evaluated
* JVM evaluation framework
* live-console tools
* Assembler to x86-64 elf binary


This is meant to be a stress-free miniature stand-in for graalvm when building exotic languages. If you need to work on more platforms, or need more advanced features, I strongly encourage stepping up to the real deal over at https://www.graalvm.org/ ( https://github.com/oracle/graal ). It's not nearly as messy to use as it looks!


This is also a private project, and as you can see I put a lot on my plate. Please understand this may go slowly!
